## Project Inspiration<a name="Inspiration"></a>

What ideas, images, or feelings will jump to our head if someone mention Boston? To me, Boston is a city in USA which has few top univeristies in the world, other than this I have zero thought about Boston. But whatâ€™s in Boston, where should we stay if we want to visit Boston? Which neighborhood suits us the best? How much does it cost per night? Can we stay with Airbnb?

I have few questions

*__Question 1__*: Can we describe the vibe of each Boston neighborhood using listing descriptions?

*__Question 2__*: Is there a general upward trend of both new Airbnb listings and total Airbnb visitors to Boston?

*__Question 3__*: How much Airbnb homes are earning in certain time frames and areas?

*__Question 4__*: If there is anything about the properties that helps you predict price?
