## Project Inspiration<a name="Inspiration"></a>

What ideas, images, or feelings will jump to our head if someone mention Boston? To me, Boston is a city in USA which has few top univeristies in the world, other than this I have zero thought about Boston. But what’s in Boston, where should we stay if we want to visit Boston? Which neighborhood suits us the best? How much does it cost per night? Can we stay with Airbnb?

I have few questions

*__Question 1__*: Can we describe the vibe of each Boston neighborhood using listing descriptions?

*__Question 2__*: Is there a general upward trend of both new Airbnb listings and total Airbnb visitors to Boston?

*__Question 3__*: How much Airbnb homes are earning in certain time frames and areas?

*__Question 4__*: If there is anything about the properties that helps you predict price?
